"""
Remove cells if cells escape the tissue.\n

This function should only be used in really extreme scenarios, e.g. where the number of cells escaping the tissue is small relative to the total number,
    and are causing unresolvable numerical errors. Increasing the boundary force tissue.Î¼b is always preferable but not always suitable, as it changes
    the movement dynamics of cells within the tissue. Warns the user if >1 cell is lost from the tissue in a timestep, indicating broader issues to the
    simulation.
